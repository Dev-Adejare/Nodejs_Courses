This code is a basic Node.js HTTP server that listens for incoming requests and logs the requested URL and HTTP method to the console. Let's break it down line by line:

1. const http = require("http");: This line imports the built-in Node.js http module, which allows you to create HTTP servers and handle HTTP requests and responses.

2. const path = require("path");: This line imports the built-in Node.js path module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

3. const fs = require("fs");: This line imports the built-in Node.js fs module, which provides functions for interacting with the file system.

4. const fsPromises = require("fs").promises;: This line imports the promises-based version of the fs module. This version provides asynchronous file system operations using promises.

5. const logEvents = require("./logEvent");: This line imports the logEvent module from the current directory. This module likely contains event logging functionality.

6. const EventEmitter = require("events");: This line imports the built-in Node.js events module, which provides an EventEmitter class that allows you to create and emit custom events.
