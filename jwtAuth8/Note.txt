Access tokens and refresh tokens are fundamental components of modern web authentication systems, especially in the context of OAuth 2.0. Here's a detailed overview of each:

ACCESS TOKEN
Purpose:
Access tokens are used to grant specific permissions and access to resources on behalf of a user. They are typically short-lived.

Characteristics:

Short Lifespan: Access tokens have a limited lifespan (often minutes to hours) to reduce the risk if the token is compromised.



REFRESH TOKEN
Purpose:
Refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again. They are typically long-lived.

Characteristics:

Long Lifespan: Refresh tokens have a much longer lifespan (days, weeks, or even months).
